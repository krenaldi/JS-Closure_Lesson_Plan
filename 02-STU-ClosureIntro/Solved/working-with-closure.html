        // Example One:
        
        var a = 10;                                 // Scope: Global
        function outer() {                          // Scope: Global
            var b = a;                              // Scope: Outer 
            console.log(b);
            function inner() {                      // Scope: Outer 
                var b = 20;                         // Scope: Inner
                var c = b;                          // Scope: Inner
                console.log(c);
            }
            inner();
        }
        outer();

        // Logs 10 , 20

        /* What would happen if we move var b = 20 to the end of inner()? What console.log(c) return?
            ANSWER: It will display undefined because even though the compiler knows there's a b variable in inner() the interpreter can't find the value of c since b is undefined at time of when console.log is called.

        // Example Two:

        var x = 10;                                  // Scope: Global
        function outer2() {                          // Scope: Global
            var y = 20;                              // Scope: Outer 
            function inner2() {                      // Scope: Outer 
                x++;                                 // Scope: Inner
                y++;                                 // Scope: Inner
                console.log(x);
                console.log(y);
            }
            inner2();
        }
        outer2();  // Logs 11, 21
        outer2();  // Logs 12, 21 - The reason why x is 12 and y is still 21 when outer2() is called a second time is because var x is in global scope and therefore in memory so when inner2() runs the first time it updates x to 11 in the global scope so when outer2() is called a 2nd time inner2() will be receiving 11 for x. Var y will always be 20 since variables declared inside functions get removed from memory once the function completes so outer2() is creating a new instance of y when ran.
